# Project Description
Evaluation of the structural difference between the ligands Acepromazine and Promazine and research on if the given ligands are good binders to protein targets dopamine receptors D1 and D2 using AMDock.

**Detailed evaluation can be found in the report.**

# Visualisation of best box poses obtained
The binding sites of the the GPCR is within plasma membrance called cavity. Used this as information to get the coordinates of the best box. <br><br>

# Results
- Promazine exhibited selectivity towards D1 than D2 [based on the results found in my docking 
calculation]. <br>
- Using the docking results and clustering histogram, I obtained, when comparing 
promazine between D1 and D2, the results for D2 for promazine was not good and could not be used, 
but while for the D1, it produced good poses which indicated potential binding sites in D1. <br>
- For the clustering histogram (for D1) overshooting happened, which could indicate a favourable pose in D1. In 
theory and reality, promazine is meant to exhibit selectivity to D2 rather than D1 leading me to 
believe I went wrong somewhere with picking the boxing size for promazine for D2. <br>
- Acepromazine produced good results for both receptors obtaining good results.
