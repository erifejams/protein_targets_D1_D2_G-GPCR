# Project Description
Evaluation of the structural difference between the ligands Acepromazine and Promazine and research on if the given ligands are good binders to protein targets dopamine receptors D1 and D2.

**More detailed information can be found in the report.**

# Visualisation of the best box poses in PyMOL
The binding sites of the the GPCR is within plasma membrance called cavity. Used this as information to get the coordinates of the best box.
